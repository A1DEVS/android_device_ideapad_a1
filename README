If you want to build CWM for the Ideapad A1, I'd recommend doing it from the tag "rev1" at the moment.

For the current built version of the recovery, see:

http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~grm08/ideapad/

Note if you build the recovery yourself: the mkimage command specified by the cyanogenmod build system doesn't pass suitable parameters to make an image that is flashable by fuse. The command you will need to run (in out/target/product/a1) are:

rm ramdisk-recovery.ub
mkimage -A arm -O linux -T ramdisk -a 0x30800000 -e 0x30800000 -n recovery -C none -d ramdisk-recovery.img ramdisk-recovery.ub
